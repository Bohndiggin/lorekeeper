# LOREKEEPER #

## Overview

Lorekeeper is the answer to a problem I've personally had with managing dungeons and dragons campaigns. As such it has many roles to fill of its own.

When I looked for solutions to manage the lore behind my campaigns, I could never find something that was simple enough to use on they fly, but also complex enough to hold all the pertiant information. I tried mind maps, word documents, and many other solutions but none filled the role I needed.

Then it hit me. SQL. PostgreSQL is a near infinite tool to make and link data. Not just that, but PostgreSQL is n-dimentional.

Lorekeeper is in its infancy, but as they say "it works on my machine"

Humor aside, more details are to follow...
